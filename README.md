Project Overview
This project focuses on the end-to-end process of extracting, cleaning, and visualizing high-volume web data to monitor user engagement and conversion metrics. By automating data ingestion from live web sources, I built a system to track "stickiness" and identifying bottlenecks in the user journey.

🛠️ Data Engineering & ETL
Automated Ingestion: Developed a web-scraping pipeline in Power BI to ingest live data from dynamic URLs (e.g., IMDb/E-commerce logs).

Power Query Transformation: Performed advanced data cleaning in the Power Query Editor, including:

Converting unstructured string data into numeric values for "Gross" and "Weeks Released."

Handling null values and normalizing data types to ensure reporting accuracy.

Reducing manual data entry and processing time by 40%.

📊 Analytics & Visualization
Conversion Funnel Analysis: Visualized the user journey to pinpoint where potential visitors drop off before completing a transaction.

Engagement Metrics: Tracked "Stickiness" (DAU/MAU) to measure the frequency of user interactions over time.

Dynamic Dashboards: Created an executive-facing dashboard featuring:

Trend Analysis: Weekend Gross vs. Weeks Released.

Comparative Metrics: Total Gross and performance by Category (Movie Title/Product).

Scalability: The dashboard was designed to handle high-volume updates (33,000+ records) without performance lag.
